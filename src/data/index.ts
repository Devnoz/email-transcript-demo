Goods need to be declared and released for EXPORT before arrival at the PORT OF EXPORT.
In order to move forward with Export Clearance HydraForce requires the following from the carrier:

Please provide the correct
PORT
details so we can provide you with the correct declaration so that you can generate
GVMS.

If this is not done, GVMS will not be able to arrive the declaration
As we move to CDS export declarations then additional information is required

If you are arriving at an inventory-controlled port, then
the haulier needs let someone know to be able to arrive the export declaration.
Once clearances are raised, they only last for 15 days so, please make sure that you are arranging collections immediately to avoid any delays.`,
